# Wunderlist

Find and save your new favorite place.

SASS, React, Redux, TypeScript, Yelp Fusion API, Google Maps API, GeoDB Cities API, Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

## Usage

Wunderlist uses a CORS Anywhere proxy in order to make requests to the Yelp Fusion API. In order to make requests, the client must first enable the use of the proxy demo server. Please request temporary access to the demo server prior to use, otherwise requests will return with a 403 Forbidden error.

Request for temporary access to the demo server can be found here: http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo.
